## Overview: Shelved
This is a personal library app that allows users to search for their favorite books and create personal bookshelves. It makes use of the Google Books API that we found [here](https://developers.google.com/books).

We got styling help for this document from [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

#### API backend

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + My Biggest challenge was definitely getting the project to build successfuly for me. A lot of my time was spent installing and reinstalling packages and error code debugging. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + It was a challenge because I had never worked with these frameworks before, so I had a great deal of trouble understanding what was going wrong and why my teammates could run it but I couldn't.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + Through chats with Graeme and countless error code lookups. 
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + I enjoyed the troubleshooting process and getting to the bottom of my issues, and then fixing them.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would probably begin going to office hours earlier in my debugging process. I spent too much time struggling on my own before asking for help. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Error codes are my friend. Sometimes clearing the slate and starting from scrath isn't always a bad idea. 

## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
  - Our project was decently successful compared to our initial vision. It was a rocky process getting it all to build correctly, but overall we have a working app that does most of what we wanted it to do. 
- What was the largest victory?
  - Our largest victory definitely when we all sucessfuly were able to build the project. It took many days and a repo change to get us all on the same page but it was a relief when we did.
