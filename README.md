## Overview: Shelved
This is a personal library app that allows users to search for their favorite books and create personal bookshelves. It makes use of the Google Books API that we found [here](https://developers.google.com/books).

We got styling help for this document from [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Introduction

#### API backend

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + My Biggest challenge was definitely getting the project to build successfully for me. A lot of my time was spent installing and reinstalling packages and error code debugging. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + It was a challenge because I had never worked with these frameworks before, so I had a great deal of trouble understanding what was going wrong and why my teammates could run it but I couldn't.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
  + Through chats with Graeme and countless error code lookups. 
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + I enjoyed the troubleshooting process and getting to the bottom of my issues, and then fixing them.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would probably begin going to office hours earlier in my debugging process. I spent too much time struggling on my own before asking for help. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Error codes are my friend. Sometimes clearing the slate and starting from scratch isn't always a bad idea.

### Mikaela Lagumbay
Mikela worked on setting up the app and being the integrator. She tried to make the app navigation and files more organized and readable and doing documentation.

+ What was the biggest challenge?
    + Managing pull requests, merges, and documentation.
+ Why was it a challenge?
    + We were all new to git/github and not everyone followed convention
+ How was the challenge addressed?
    + I went to the TA and teachers for help and used ChatGPT and the internet to get more comfortable with git.      
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
    + Working on the pages.
+If you could do it over, what would you change?
    + I would try my best to help set up the database quick and start early   
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
    + The importance of starting work early and planning.

### Fernando Ponce
Fernando worked on the landing page and made sure books were able to get added using the API.

+ What was the biggest challenge?
    + Getting books added from one page to another using the API information. 
+ Why was it a challenge?
    + I had trouble managing the state and passing the data between files.
+ How was the challenge addressed?
    + A lot of reading documentation, and using chatGPT to help me debug. 
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
    + Favorite part was seeing the app gain functionality, and working together with my team.
+If you could do it over, what would you change?
    + I would communicate better with my team, and make sure we're all on the same page.
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
    + Working on things early and planning help a lot.

#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
Gerardo worked on creating and managing the user database as well as the library database. He was also in charge of making Google OAuth functional.

+ What was the biggest challenge? 
	+The biggest challenge was getting the app running we all had different issues with our first repo and kept running into a wall when we wanted to work on our code
+ Why was it a challenge?
	+We were all new to using GitHub pull requests and we didnâ€™t divide up the work as well as we should have
  + How was the challenge addressed?
	  +We restarted the repo and a new expo app so we could implement everyone's code one at a time this time with pull requests
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
	+My favorite part of the project was also my least favorite it was rebuilding and cleaning the grade after finishing my database. This was because it kept crashing at the same spot and I would fix something and something else would crash but then seeing the gradle rebuilt successfully after hours of trying felt the best
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
	+I would change how we communicated in the begging and how we handled task distributions as well as restart the repo as soon as we were getting huge conflicts
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
	+The most valuable thing I learned was team management because, in the end, we all needed to come together to get this to work


## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
  - Our project was decently successful compared to our initial vision. It was a rocky process getting it all to build correctly, but overall we have a working app that does most of what we wanted it to do. 
- What was the largest victory?
  - Our largest victory definitely when we all sucessfuly were able to build the project. It took many days and a repo change to get us all on the same page but it was a relief when we did.
